/**
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Purpose: GraphViz Java API
 * <dd>
 *
 * <dt>Description:
 * <dd> With this Java class you can simply call dot
 *      from your Java programs
 * <dt>Example usage:
 * <dd>
 * <pre>
 *    GraphViz gv = new GraphViz();
 *    gv.addln(gv.start_graph());
 *    gv.addln("A -> B;");
 *    gv.addln("A -> C;");
 *    gv.addln(gv.end_graph());
 *    System.out.println(gv.getDotSource());
 *
 *    String type = "gif";
 *    File out = new File("out." + type);   // out.gif in this example
 *    gv.writeGraphToFile( gv.getGraph( gv.getDotSource(), type ), out );
 * </pre>
 * </dd>
 *
 * </dl>
 *
 * @version v0.4, 2011/02/05 (February) -- Patch of Keheliya Gallaba is added. Now you
 * can specify the type of the output file: gif, dot, fig, pdf, ps, svg, png, etc.
 * @version v0.3, 2010/11/29 (November) -- Windows support + ability 
 * to read the graph from a text file
 * @version v0.2, 2010/07/22 (July) -- bug fix
 * @version v0.1, 2003/12/04 (December) -- first release
