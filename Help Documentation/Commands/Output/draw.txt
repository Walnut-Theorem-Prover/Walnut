The "draw" command creates a ".gv" file from the ".txt" definition of a Word Automaton saved in "Word Automata Library/", or of an ordinary automaton saved in "Automata Library/".

The syntax for the "draw" command for Word Automata is as follows:

	draw <name>

Results saved in: Result/.

For ordinary automata, prepend the "$" symbol to the automaton name:

	draw $<name>

For example, to draw a Word Automaton named "AUT" saved in "Word Automata Library/", one writes

	draw AUT

To draw an automaton named "aut" saved in "Automata Library/", one writes

	draw $aut
