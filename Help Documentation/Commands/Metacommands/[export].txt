The "export" metacommand exports intermediate automata to a specified format: currently only BA is supported.

Intermediate word automata aren't supported, since BA format can't handle DFAOs.

The export syntax for the metacommand is as follows:
[export 0 BA]   ##  export the 0th intermediate automaton
[export * BA]      ##  export all automaton (wildcard)

Example usage:

[export * BA]eval shortExample "T[a] < b"::

This exports the intermediate automata generated during the eval command.
These are generated as: shortExample_pre_0.ba, ..., shortExample_pre_n.ba.

The "_pre" refers to these being generated before determinization happens.

The exported results are saved in the session Result/ subdirectory.
