One may reverse a Word Automaton or an Automaton using the "reverse" command, with the following syntax:

	reverse <new> <old>

Results saved in: Result/, Word Automata Library/.

NOTE: Reversing an automaton will flip the number system from msd to lsd, and vice versa.

For example, if reversing a word automaton "DEJ" saved in "Word Automata Library/DEJ.txt" with a number system of msd_19, one runs:

	reverse DEJREV DEJ

"DEJREV" will be a Word Automaton that is the reverse of "DEJ", with a number system of lsd_19, and will be saved in Word Automata Library/.

To reverse regular automata (that is, not Word Automata) using the "reverse" command, one prepends the "$" symbol (without the quotation marks) to the old automaton's name. The result will be saved in the "Automata Library/" directory.

For example, to reverse an Automaton named "foo" saved in "Automata Library/", one writes

	reverse bar $foo

The resulting automaton "bar" will be saved in "Automata Library/".
