The right quotient of two automata M1 and M2 is defined to be the automaton that accepts the right quotient L1/L2 = {w | exists x in L2 : wx is in L1}, where L1 and L2 are the languages accepted by M1 and M2 respectively.

The syntax for the "rightquo" command is as follows:

	rightquo <new> <old1> <old2>

Results saved in: Result/, Automata Library/.

The alphabet of <old2> should be a subset of that of <old1>, and the <new> automaton will have the alphabet of <old1>. For example, to take the right quotient "res" of automata named "a1" and "a2" all saved in "Automata Library/", one uses the following command:

	rightquo res a1 a2

The resulting automaton "res" is saved in "Automata Library/".
