The syntax for the "concat" command is as follows:

	concat <new> <old1> ... <oldN>

Results saved in: Result/, Automata Library/.

The "concat" command requires at least two input automata. All automata must have the same input alphabet.

For example, to take the concatenation "res" of automata named "a1", "a2", "a3" and "a4", all saved in "Automata Library/", one uses the following command:

	concat res a1 a2 a3 a4

The resulting automaton "res" is saved in "Automata Library/", and accepts the concatenation of the inputs accepted by "a1", "a2", "a3" and "a4".

NOTE: The alphabet of the resulting automaton "res" will be changed if one of the input alphabets of the input automata is not a set alphabet (i.e. {0, 1}) or of the form msd_k or lsd_k. Use the "alphabet" command to force an alphabet on the resulting automaton. For example, if "a1", "a2", "a3", "a4" above are msd_fib automata, "res" will be an msd_2 automaton.
