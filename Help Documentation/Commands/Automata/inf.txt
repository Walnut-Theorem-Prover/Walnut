The "inf" command determines whether or not an automaton accepts infinitely many inputs. If it does, Walnut returns a regular expression defining an infinite family of accepted inputs. The syntax of the "inf" command is as follows:
	
	inf <name>
	
Leading/trailing zeroes are removed (depending on whether the automaton is msd or lsd). The function searches for a cycle, and if one is found, constructs a prefix from the initial state q0 to it, and from it to an accepting state, such that the prefix and suffix are minimal for the particular cycle. This works with multiple arity as well.
