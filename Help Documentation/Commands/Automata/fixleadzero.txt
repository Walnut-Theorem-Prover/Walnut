The syntax for the "fixleadzero" command is as follows:

	fixleadzero <new> <old>
	
Results saved in: Result/, Automata Library/.

The automaton <old> should be saved in "Automata Library/" and be a regular automaton (not a Word Automaton).

The resulting automaton <new> accepts an input 0* x' if and only if <old> accepts an input x, where x' is x with its leading zeroes removed.

For example, if "aut" is saved in "Automata Library/", one writes
	
	fixleadzero res aut
	
Then the resulting automaton "res" is saved in "Automata Library/".
