The "test" command outputs the first n values accepted by an automaton in lexicographic order, where n is a number supplied by the user.
The syntax for the "test" command is as follows:
	
	test <name> <number>
	
If fewer than n values are accepted, all accepted values are printed in lexicographic order.

Note that inputs that begin with 0 (or [0,0] with over 2 arguments, etc.) are not listed.
This is because the default representation for numbers in automata ignores most-significant 0s.
