The "test" command outputs the first n values accepted by an automaton in LSD radix order (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort), where n is a number supplied by the user.

The syntax for the "test" command is as follows:
	
	test <name> <number>
	
If fewer than n values are accepted, all accepted values are printed in LSD radix order.

Note that inputs that begin with 0 (or [0,0] with over 2 arguments, etc.) are not listed.
This is because the default representation for numbers in automata ignores most-significant 0s.
