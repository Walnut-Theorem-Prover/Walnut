The syntax for the "union" command is as follows:

	union <new> <old1> [old2] [old3] ... [oldN]

Results saved in: Result/, Automata Library/.

The "union" command requires at least one input automaton. All automata must have the same input alphabet.

For example, to take the union "res" of automata named "a1" and "a2" both saved in "Automata Library/", one uses the following command:

	union res a1 a2

The resulting automaton "res" is saved in "Automata Library/", and accepts the union of the inputs accepted by "a1" and "a2".
