The "image" command applies a uniform morphism to a DFAO to produce a new DFAO. The syntax is as follows:

	image <name> <morphism> <DFAO>
	
Results saved in: Result/, Word Automata Library/.

Walnut's procedure to apply the uniform morphism is as per Cobham, A. Uniform tag sequences. Math. Systems Theory 6, 164–192 (1972). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01706087.

If the morphism supplied is not uniform, an error will be produced.
