One may change the alphabet of a Word Automaton using the "alphabet" command as follows:

	alphabet <new> <alphabet1> [alphabet2] ... [alphabetN] <old>

Results saved in: Result/, Word Automata Library/.

The alphabet of the resulting automaton <new> is set to the input alphabets, and all invalid transitions are removed from the new automaton.

The number of alphabets in the command must equal to the number of input alphabets of the <old> automaton.

For example, if "AUT" (saved in "Word Automata Library/") has the alphabets "msd_2 msd_2 msd_fib", to set its alphabets to "msd_fib msd_fib msd_4", one writes

	alphabet RES msd_fib msd_fib msd_4 AUT


To apply the "alphabet" command to regular automata (that is, not Word Automata), one prepends the "$" symbol (without the quotation marks) to the old automaton's name. The result will be saved in the "Automata Library/" directory.

For example, if "foo" (saved in "Automata Library/") has alphabet "msd_fib", to set its alphabet to "msd_2" one writes

	alphabet bar msd_2 $foo

The resulting automaton "bar" will be saved in "Automata Library/".
