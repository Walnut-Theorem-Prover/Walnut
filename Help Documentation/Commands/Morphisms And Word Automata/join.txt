Given multiple DFAO's (Word Automata), the "join" command produces a DFAO with output equal to the first non-zero output. The syntax of the "join" command is

	join <new> <DFAO1> ... <DFAOn>

For example, if N1, N2, N3 are DFAO's with two inputs, then

	join M N1[a][b] N2[b][c] N3[a][c]

produces a new DFAO M which, on inputs (a,b,c), outputs 

N1[a][b] if it is nonzero

N2[b][c] if it is nonzero, but N1[a][b] is zero

N3[a][c] if it is nonzero, but both N1[a][b] and N2[b][c] are zero.
