The "promote" command converts a morphism to its equivalent DFAO. The syntax for the "promote" command is:

	promote <name> <morphism>

Note that any morphism used must not have negative values in the domain or range, since automata have states numbered from 0.

For example, if the Thue-Morse morphism "thue" is created as follows:

	morphism thue "0->01 1->10"

Then, the "promote" command is used to create a DFAO "T" equivalent to the morphism "thue" as follows:

	promote T thue
	
The word automaton T is then defined as follows:

msd_2

0 0
0 -> 0
1 -> 1

1 1
0 -> 1
1 -> 0
