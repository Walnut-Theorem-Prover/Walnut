The "export" command exports an automaton to the specified export format (if supported).
Currently supported formats are Graphviz (.gv) and BA (.ba) formats. Walnut (.txt) is unnecessary, since this command is actually reading from a .txt file.

A Word automaton can be exported to Graphviz format. Exporting to BA format is not supported (it can't handle DFAO).

An ordinary automaton can be exported to either Graphviz or BA formats.

The syntax for the "export" command for Word Automata is as follows:

	export <name> <format>

For ordinary automata, prepend the "$" symbol to the automaton name:

	export $<name> <format>

For example, to export a Word Automaton named "AUT" saved in "Word Automata Library/" to Graphviz format, write:

	export AUT GV

To export an automaton named "aut" saved in "Automata Library/" to Graphviz and BA formats, write:

	export $aut GV
	export $aut BA
