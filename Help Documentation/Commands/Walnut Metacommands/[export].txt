The "export" metacommand exports intermediate automata to the BA (.ba) format.

Intermediate word automata aren't supported, since BA format can't handle DFAOs.

The export syntax for the metacommand is as follows:
[export 0]   ##  export the 0th intermediate automaton
[export *]   ##  export all automaton (wildcard)

Example usage:

[export *]eval shortExample "T[a] < b"::

This exports the intermediate automata generated during the eval command.
These are generated as: shortExample_pre_0.ba, ..., shortExample_pre_n.ba.

The "_pre" refers to these being generated before determinization happens.

The exported results are saved in the session Result/ subdirectory.
